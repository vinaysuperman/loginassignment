                    <h1>Having A Good Artistic Eye</h1>
                    <p>I’m a self-professed mountain boy/mountain lover/ mountain climber.
                    Except that here’s the thing: I don’t even live in the mountains – not even close!
                    Years ago I traded in my mountain lifestyle for a new and exciting opportunity on the other side of the country –
                    and I wouldn’t change that decision for the world! But I must confess what I can’t shake…the mountains stole my heart.</p>
